# TweetBee
A Twitter Bot that that will automatically like posts from hashtag, username and also finds a way to follow people...using there pattern of likes. The people who likes a particular hashtag, the bot will search for these people and then send them follow requests.


I used the Twitter developer api tool that you can access at https://developer.twitter.com/en   
registered and created a api bot with Read and Post option enabled and generated some Api keys / Secret keys and coded in Pycharm professional 2019 using the Tweepy and time module 

dw , i will be changing the Api keys soon ;)
